# 🔍 How to Watch Instagram Stories Anonymously

### Using a Bit of HTML Hydration, Smart Headers, and Zero GraphQL Calls

---

## 📷 The Problem

You want to watch someone's Instagram story — maybe for research, testing, or just plain curiosity — **without them knowing**.

Normally, the moment you tap "View Story," Instagram logs you. Your view is attached to your account and the uploader sees you in the viewer list. Incognito mode? Useless. Fake accounts? Tedious.

What if you could **bypass the tracking entirely**?

---

## 💡 The Insight

Instagram's web app loads a *fully hydrated snapshot* of a user's story data **right in the HTML** — thanks to how modern web frameworks like React or Next.js work.

Rather than dynamically fetching story data with authenticated API calls, Instagram:

* Injects JSON payloads into the server-rendered HTML
* Relies on client-side hydration to turn that into a working feed
* Sends tracking events (like story views) **after the story player is initialized**

And here's the catch:

> If you **extract the media URLs directly from the hydrated JSON**, you can **view the raw media without triggering any tracking**.

---

## 🧪 The Technique

This method works because you're not "viewing a story" in the conventional sense — you're:

1. Visiting the public story page (`instagram.com/stories/{username}/`)
2. Reading the server-rendered HTML
3. Parsing the embedded JSON (look for `reels_media`, `tray`, etc.)
4. Extracting the direct CDN-hosted media URLs (images/videos)
5. Viewing those media assets directly — just like a browser loading a JPEG

### ✅ Why It’s Anonymous

* You **never load the official Instagram story viewer**, which triggers the view.
* You don’t make any **GraphQL mutations** or log telemetry.
* You only do a **GET request** to fetch public HTML and **read embedded data**.

---

## 🔧 What You Need

* A logged-in session (cookies) for Instagram — since most stories require authentication.
* Basic HTTP tools (like `fetch`, `curl`, or even a browser).
* A way to parse the HTML and extract hydrated JSON (`cheerio`, regex, etc.).
* A user-agent and headers that mimic a real browser (to avoid being blocked).



Example: 
```js module.exports = async function instaFetch(username, id) {
    try {

        let response = await fetch(`https://www.instagram.com/stories/${username}`, {

        const match = regex.exec(data);
